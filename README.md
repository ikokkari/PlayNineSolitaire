# Play Nine Solitaire

A fun little Python programming project suitable for an introduction level course on artificial intelligence and decision making.

A framework that runs the mechanisms for a solitaire version of [Play Nine](https://playnine.com) multiplayer card game is provided by the instructor. The students should then define and implement the required three functions of the [play_nine_player](https://github.com/ikokkari/PlayNineSolitaire/blob/main/play_nine_player.py) script to perform the decision making at various stages of this game.

This project is released under GPLv3, and can be used by all teachers and learners of Python and artificial intelligence.
