# PlayNineSolitaire

A fun little Python programming project for an artificial intelligence course.

A framework that runs the mechanisms for a solitaire version of [Play Nine](https://playnine.com) multiplayer card game is provided. The students should define and implement the methods of the [play_nine_player](https://github.com/ikokkari/PlayNineSolitaire/blob/main/play_nine_player.py) script to perform the decision making at various stages of the game.

This project is released under GPLv3, and can be used by all teachers and learners of Python and artificial intelligence.
